# Project Description

Project forked and inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/karinait/credit_card_fraud_predictor). Dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The goal of this project is to use Logistic Regression to predict fraudulent transactions using pyTorch and a custom build model class taught in class.

The reference class can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/ppgeec2318/blob/main/lessons/week05/week05c.ipynb)

The dataset will be taken as is, without any preprocessing.
